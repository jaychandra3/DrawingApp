Those who are most in need of help are often ignored by the major players in the medical space. GAMI aims to leverage the technical expertise and passion of students around the world as well as the invaluable experience of healthcare professionals to develop impactful technologies, policies, and programs and make healthcare accessible to all.").textStyle(BodyTextStyle()).padding()

The team advisors from Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences and from Harvard Medical School Teaching Hospitals bring expertise in the mathematical analysis of physical phenomena such as handwriting, gait, and eye movement and clinical knowledge in neurodegenerative disease treatment.
